# python/bash scripts for making EM processing easier

## makesum.py

create some nice summary and plots of EM micrographs

I wanted a summary file for my collected micrographs ( movies - not yet ). This is an attempt to simplify that process. It uses either Gctf or ctfind to calculate the Defocus values and resolution estimates..
